Occasionally, the receiving of an installation package on the VCU/SCU
from the TCU fails, either because it never got everything (there is a
printout "ready?" followed by two numbers), or because the reading of
frames (the smallest units of data that are sent) got out of synch
(there is a printout "consec: not same sequence number").

Performing the same operation again will probably be successful. If the
VCU/SCU crashed, it has to be restarted first.

When powered by the aggregate, trying to use the servo/motor can make
the TCU (and maybe everything) immediately restart. When by battery,
it works well.  I think this is due to a fall in voltage, not to a
loose connection.

If one node receives messages on the CAN bus from two different sources
too fast, it may happen that packets get lost.

Sometimes an IMU doesn't report any values at all for up to several
seconds, for an unknown reason.
