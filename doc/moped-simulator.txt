Add note:
modify config/system1.xml to point out where the trusted server is

The simulator acts like a car towards the server, and can have plugins
installed and run (and uninstalled) in it, as well as be remote
controlled from Android. The position of the car being simulated is
shown by a small rectangle in a graphic window.


To run the simulator:
cd simulator
java -jar target/simulator-1.0.jar

simulator's PIRTE defines these virtual ports:
0 publish
3 accelerator motorPower
4 steering steeringAngle
5 frontwheel vehicleSpeed
6 rearwheel vehicleSpeed
7 voltage voltage
9 LED lamp

The car is drawn as a rectangle with an arrow in the front part.
The angle of steering is not shown.

remote control

Restrictions:
Voltage is fake - it returns a constant.
LED values are not shown graphically, but only on stdout.
plugins cannot communicate (I think)

The simulator is meant to be able to simulate several cars at once,
but this does not fully work.
