This is the main documentation file for MOPED. It does not contain
very much except references to other files.

To understand the rest of this document, you may want to read
moped-overview.txt, where the architecture is broadly described, and
special terms introduced.

(This document is written in the first person, because I did mostly not
construct any of the above, and my competence in describing the parts
varies a bit.)


To get a complete MOPED system up and running from scratch, you need to
perform the following steps:

install maven


A Fetch the source code from github.
  git clone https://github.com/sics-sse/moped
  This will create a directory "moped" in your current directory.

B Set up a mysql server. Wordpress already uses one, so if it's convenient,
  we can use the same one.
  See moped-mysql.txt.

C Build the MOPED system, and start the server.
  See moped-building.txt.

D Set up a wordpress server with the MOPED GUI files. 
  See moped-setup-gui.txt.

E Build the remote control app for Android.
  See moped-android.txt.

F Construct a car, or get acquainted with an existing one. I haven't
  written documentation for constructing a car, but there is a description of
  some parts of existing ones.
  See moped-car.txt.

G Put the appropriate code from C on three SD cards, one for each
  Raspberry Pie on the car.

A needs to be done first. Then the order is not always important, but
these ordering requirements exist:
B->C->D, C->G.

When you have a running system, you may want to do these things:

* Write and run plugins, either in the car, or in the simulator.
  Some plugins are included.
  See moped-plugins.txt, moped-simulator.txt, moped-gui.txt.

* Extend or debug the system
  See moped-system.txt


B, C and D can be done on the same computer, or on different ones. I haven't
had B and C on different computers, so I didn't learn how to set up a
secure connection to mysql, but use "localhost".

There are two ways for the user to communicate with the server: using
the (web) GUI, or calling the server's web services directly, using some
programming language. For the latter, see moped-server-api.txt.


Github has a list of issues, which are suggested changes or problems to
be fixed. Issues which are not included there (yet) are listed in
moped-problems.txt.

Things that don't fit into any of the text files mentioned above are put
into moped-misc.txt.

On the MOPED site http://moped.sics.se you can find additional material,
for example explaining the architecture.


This should happen soon:
"FRESTA" replaced with "MOPED"
"new-server" moved to "server"
hard-coded paths and ports made changeable through a configuration file.

new-server/src/main/java/service/PluginWebServicesImpl.java
    private SuiteGen suiteGen = new SuiteGen("/home/arndt/moped/moped/squawk");
	    String dir = "/home/arndt/moped/moped/webportal/moped_plugins/" + appname
	    String SCHEMA_PATH = "/home/arndt/moped/moped/xml/vehicleconfig.xsd";
	String zipFile = "/home/arndt/moped/moped/webportal/moped_plugins/" + appname + "/" + version + "/" + appname + ".jar";
