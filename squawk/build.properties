TRUE=true

# PLATFORM TYPE may be one of:
#   BARE_METAL - Squawk runs on the bare metal, implementing interrupts, timers, etc.
#   DELEGATING - Squawk delegates all IO to another JVM, via JNI
#   NATIVE     - Squawk runs on an OS, and calls native OS routines for IO, etc.
#   SOCKET     - Squawk delagates all IO to another JVM, via a socket
#
# The builder will synthesize definitions of four additional properties: PLATFORM_TYPE_BARE_METAL,
# PLATFORM_TYPE_DELEGATING, PLATFORM_TYPE_NATIVE, and PLATFORM_TYPE_SOCKET, which can be used
